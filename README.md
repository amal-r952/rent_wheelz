# goDrive

goDrive is a Flutter application that allows users to search for rental cars seamlessly. The app
integrates Google Places for autofilling search fields, Google Maps for pinpointing exact locations,
and a date picker for selecting rental periods. Instead of displaying rental listings in-app,
goDrive redirects users to a mobile browser with search results.

## ✨ Features

- **🌙 Auto Dark Mode & Light Mode**
    - The app automatically adapts to the device's system theme.

- **📍 Google Places Autofill**
    - Users can quickly search for car rentals with autofill suggestions powered by Google Places.

- **🗺️ Google Maps Integration**
    - The app provides precise location selection using Google Maps.

- **📆 Date Picker**
    - Users can select rental dates using an intuitive date picker.

- **🌐 Browser Redirection**
    - Once a search is performed, results open directly in a mobile browser for booking.

- **🚀 Automatic GitHub Release**
    - The project includes a **GitHub Actions workflow** that builds the APK and automatically
      creates a new release.
